# Toolchains

This project is related to this YouTube video:

[How to use Apache Maven Toolchains in an Apache Maven Project.][video].

I have changed the property name from `toolchains` into `toolchains.version` and
`vendor` into `toolchain.vendor` to make easier to understand on contradiction
to the video.
